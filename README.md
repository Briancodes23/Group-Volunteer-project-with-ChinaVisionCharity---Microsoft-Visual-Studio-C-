What does the project do?

This project was intended to be a website which benefits visually impaired users by improving the user interface design features & functionality. My responsibility within the project was paired programming with a team member & designing the website wireframe template.

Note: This is not the final version of the complete development project, this was one of test projects during the planning & testing stages which i'm using for learning purposes.
